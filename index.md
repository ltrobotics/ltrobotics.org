Lake Travis High School Robotics has been active from 2019-2023.\
\
Our coach for this year is Mr. Eric Fogle.\
\
Currently, the program consist of nine varsity and 6 junior varsity teams.\
\
Two of our teams competed at the 2023 VEX World Championship: Parallax(654X) and Omnitron(654A).\
\
We are a small but successful program, having sent 3 teams to VEX Worlds in 2022.
